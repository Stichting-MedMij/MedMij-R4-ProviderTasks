Title: "pt DigitalActivity"
Description: "Reusable definition of a digital activity (module) that can be selected by a healthcare professional and presented to a patient as part of the care process. The activity describes what the patient will do (e.g., read information, complete a questionnaire, perform a home measurement) and provides the information needed to start or access the activity."

The slice is modelled after the endpoint extension on the Koppeltaal KT2ActivityDefinition profile (http://koppeltaal.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/KT2EndpointExtension), including its 1..* cardinality: a digital activity is only usable when it can be launched, so at least one endpoint is always present. Provider Tasks defines its own extension rather than reusing the Koppeltaal one because the referenced Endpoint is constrained to pt-Endpoint."
