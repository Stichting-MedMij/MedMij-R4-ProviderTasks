  * ^comment = "A tag is used because R4 offers no better place to categorize a Task. `Task.code` is not suitable: it states what kind of work is to be performed (e.g. a blood pressure measurement or a saturation measurement), not which data service the Task belongs to. Unlike most other resources, Task has no `category` element; this gap has been raised with HL7 in [FHIR-57849](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-57849)."

This extension holds a literal `Reference(pt-DigitalActivity)` instead, which the custom SearchParameter `digital-activity` targets so that Tasks can be searched by their digital activity and retrieved together with it using `_include`. The same approach is taken by the `instantiates` extension on the Koppeltaal KT2Task profile (http://koppeltaal.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/KT2Task). `Task.instantiatesCanonical` is not used in Provider Tasks: receivers of a Task can ignore any value in it and should look for the digital activity in this extension."
